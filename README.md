Running Tests
-------------

### Python
Before you will be able to run these tests you will need to have Python 2.6 installed.

__note__

The below instructions will install the required Python libraries into your
global Python installation. If you work on multiple Python projects that might
end up needing different versions of the same libraries, you might want to
follow `sudo easy_install pip` with `sudo pip install virtualenv`, and then
create and activate a [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org) (e.g. `virtualenv
caseconductor-tests-env; source case-conductor-tests-env/bin/activate`) to
create a clean "virtual environment" for just this project. Then you can `pip
install -r requiremenst/mozwebqa.txt` in your virtual environment without
needing to use `sudo`.

If you don't mind installing globally, just run

    sudo easy_install pip

followed by

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

__note__

If you are running on Ubuntu/Debian you will need to first do

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

to install the required Python libraries.

### Running tests locally

To run tests locally it's a simple case of calling py.test from the root directory.

    py.test --driver=firefox tests/desktop

For more command line options see https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-mozwebqa
