Running Tests
-------------

### Java
You will need a version of the [Java Runtime Environment][JRE] installed

[JRE]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

### Python
Before you will be able to run these tests you will need to have Python 2.6 installed.

__note__

The below instructions will install the required Python libraries into your
global Python installation. If you work on multiple Python projects that might
end up needing different versions of the same libraries, you might want to
follow `sudo easy_install pip` with `sudo pip install virtualenv`, and then
create and activate a [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org) (e.g. `virtualenv
caseconductor-tests-env; source case-conductor-tests-env/bin/activate`) to
create a clean "virtual environment" for just this project. Then you can `pip
install -r requiremenst/mozwebqa.txt` in your virtual environment without
needing to use `sudo`.

If you don't mind installing globally, just run

    sudo easy_install pip

followed by

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

__note__

If you are running on Ubuntu/Debian you will need to first do

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

to install the required Python libraries.

### Selenium
Once this is all set up you will need to download and start a Selenium server. You can download the latest Selenium server from [here][Selenium Downloads]. The filename will be something like 'selenium-server-standalone-x.x.jar (where x.x is current shipping version)'

To start the Selenium server run the following command:

    java -jar ~/Downloads/selenium-server-standalone-x.x.jar (where x.x is current shipping version)

Change the path/name to the downloaded Selenium server file.

### Running tests locally

To run tests locally it's a simple case of calling py.test from the root directory.

    py.test
